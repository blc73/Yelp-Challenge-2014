Yelp-Challenge-2014
===================

Code for my submission to the yelp challenge

Code is meant to be run with Stata (http://www.stata.com/)

Two small things need to happen for the scripts to run through:

1) A project folder needs to be set up, with five folders inside. See script 01, lines 9-10, for directions.

2) Download netsis and netplot for stata: e.g., "findit netsis" and "findit netplot".

Throughout the code, there is a reference to "Index.dta". This is the un-analyzed Yelp Dataset Challenge data. It is in Stata "long" format, with 229,907 rows. If one has the Challenge data in excel, data can be converted from an excel file to stata with the "import excel" commands.

Thanks.
