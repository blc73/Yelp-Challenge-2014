Yelp-Challenge-2014
===================

Code for my submission to the yelp challenge

The code is meant to be run with Stata (http://www.stata.com/). If you work for Yelp and are judging my submission, email me and I will send you the data set in Stata-ready format. blc73@cornell.edu. In the code, this dataset is called "Index.dta"

Two small things need to happen for the scripts to run through:

1) A project folder needs to be set up, with five folders inside. See script 01, lines 9-10, for directions.

2) Download netsis and netplot for Stata: e.g., enter "findit netsis" and "findit netplot" in Stata.


Thanks! :)
